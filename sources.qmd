I collected my data from ["S&P 500 Companies with Financial Information"](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/paytonfisher/sp-500-companies-with-financial-information), uploaded to Kaggle by Payton Fisher in July 2020. To alter this dataset, I first created a column for percent earnings per share by dividing earnings per share by earnings price. I then filtered out extreme outliers from each financial ratio used in this project. 

I used ChatGPT to assist with my code.
